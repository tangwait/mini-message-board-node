# mini-message-board-node

in this lesson I learned and applied node.js skills to make a dynamic
webpage.

I learned:
    to create a basic app.js
    the connections between app.js to routes to views
    to make view templates and apply them to view pages
    how routers take information/variables to display them in view
    get/set/use/post
    to structurally organize my code for readability and organization
